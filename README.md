# QMK Keymaps

This repository contains my keyboard layouts for dz60 and KBD8x MK II

## Requirements

To utilize the `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` script you are required to have [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) installed. You can also manually install the keyboards by manually copying over them to your qmk_firmware directory

## Install

    $ ./install.sh /path/to/qmk_firmware

## Uninstall

    $ ./uninstall.sh /path/to/qmk_firmware
